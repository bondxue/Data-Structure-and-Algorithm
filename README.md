# Data Structure and Algorithm

### Project 1

This project covers the foundations of Data Structures including `Arrays`, `Linked Lists`, `Queues`, `Recursion`, `Trees`, `Maps`, and `Hashing`.

### Project 2

This project covers basic algorithms including `Binary Search`, `Heaps`, `Tries`, `Sorting` Algorithms (`Bubble`, `Merge`, `Quick`, and `Heap sort`), and `Divide and Conquer` Algorithms.

### Project 3

This project covers advanced algorithms including `Greedy Algorithms`, `Graph Algorithms`, and `Dynamic Programming`. The final project utilized the` A*` Algorithm to create a route planner.
